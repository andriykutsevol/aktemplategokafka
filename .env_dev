# If you do not want to set default values for each profile
# you can divide your docker-compose.yml file into multiple files for each profile.
# But then:
#   Create a network outside of any specific Docker Compose file.
#   Attach your services in both files to this external network.
#   This allows services to communicate using their service names.
#   The most robust approach is to implement health checks at the application level.
#   Your "producer_dev" application can periodically check the health of the "kafka" service by attempting to connect to it.
#   depends_on does not work across separate docker-compose files.
#   depends_on is not recommended for dependencies across separate Docker Compose files
#   Application-level health checks provide the most accurate and robust health monitoring
